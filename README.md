# School-Management-System
This is my first solo node project and I decided to try to implement a basic management system for a school.

In this system you have the ability to add to a mongoDB database where the students information is stored. The data stored includes the students name, school id, schedule and grades. You first create a student by entering
their name and a new school id to their profile. After that you have the option of either creating a schedule for them, updating the students grades, removing the student from the system, or retieve the students information.
There is protection again assigning grades to a student who does not have a schedule but not safetly against multiple students having the same student id.

This was all written in one day and if I might go and update this later with safeguards against having multiple people with the same student id, but for right now I'm considering this mini project done.
